		"desc": "*1.4 Prydwen Tier List (18/12/2024)*\n\n- *[Miyabi]* has been added to the tier list,\n- *[Harumasa]* has been added to the tier list,\n- *We have combined the Pure DPS and Anomaly DPS columns into one column - DPS.* We’ve intended on doing this for a while now but the release of Miyabi solidified the decision. The Anomaly Category was created under the premise that Anomaly characters would play vastly different to Attack characters much like Grace is different than a character like Soldier 11. This is not how things played out post release. A lot of Anomaly characters function as direct damage dealers akin to Attack characters with the main distinction being one stacks Anomaly related stats and the other stacks CRIT but now with Miyabi even that line is blurred. In ZZZ under the current meta we feel Attack and Anomaly characters can directly be compared in terms of performance, their roles are not different enough to keep them separate and so we have combined them. As a result of this change some characters ranking have been updated to make sense. As always we’ll be reading your feedback,\n- We have added the *meta-lines* that are already present in our other tier lists. They split the tier list into 3 groups, showcasing roughly how they are currently used in the meta: Apex (best of the best), Meta (great characters) and Niche (characters with issues that require more work to achieve good results). There's no Forgotten Ones group yet as the meta isn't in as bad state as HSR and everyone is viable - more or less,\n- We have added a new tag - *Quick Swap.* The tag highlights characters that benefit greatly from swapping to another character during one or many of their abilities that have incredibly long animations. This allows this downside to be mitigated.\n- We have changed the color of the Anomaly related tags like Shock, Burn and Disorder to make them stand out a bit more."
